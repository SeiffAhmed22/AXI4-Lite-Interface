# AXI4-Lite-Interface
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of the AXI4-Lite interface, a lightweight and high-performance bus protocol used for communication between master and slave devices in SoCs (System on Chips). The AXI4-Lite interface is part of the AXI4 protocol family and is optimized for low-complexity control-register-style interactions.
